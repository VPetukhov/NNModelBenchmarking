We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called “dropout” that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.

Title: Multi-Sample Dropout for Accelerated Training and Better Generalization
Abstract:
  Dropout is a simple but efficient regularization technique for achieving better generalization of deep neural networks (DNNs); hence it is widely used in tasks based on DNNs. During training, dropout randomly discards a portion of the neurons to avoid overfitting. This paper presents an enhanced dropout technique, which we call multi-sample dropout, for both accelerating training and improving generalization over the original dropout. The original dropout creates a randomly selected subset (called a dropout sample) from the input in each training iteration while the multi-sample dropout creates multiple dropout samples. The loss is calculated for each sample, and then the sample losses are averaged to obtain the final loss. This technique can be easily implemented by duplicating a part of the network after the dropout layer while sharing the weights among the duplicated fully connected layers. Experimental results using image classification tasks including ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 showed that multi-sample dropout accelerates training. Moreover, the networks trained using multi-sample dropout achieved lower error rates compared to networks trained with the original dropout. The additional computation cost due to the duplicated operations is not significant for deep convolutional networks because most of the computation time is consumed in the convolution layers before the dropout layer, which are not duplicated.

Title: DeepShift: Towards Multiplication-Less Neural Networks
Abstract:
  The high computation, memory, and power budgets of inferring convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are major bottlenecks of model deployment to edge computing platforms, e.g., mobile devices and IoT. Moreover, training CNNs is time and energy-intensive even on high-grade servers. Convolution layers and fully connected layers, because of their intense use of multiplications, are the dominant contributor to this computation budget.   We propose to alleviate this problem by introducing two new operations: convolutional shifts and fully-connected shifts which replace multiplications with bitwise shift and sign flipping during both training and inference. During inference, both approaches require only 5 bits (or less) to represent the weights. This family of neural network architectures (that use convolutional shifts and fully connected shifts) is referred to as DeepShift models. We propose two methods to train DeepShift models: DeepShift-Q which trains regular weights constrained to powers of 2, and DeepShift-PS that trains the values of the shifts and sign flips directly.   Very close accuracy, and in some cases higher accuracy, to baselines are achieved. Converting pre-trained 32-bit floating-point baseline models of ResNet18, ResNet50, VGG16, and GoogleNet to DeepShift and training them for 15 to 30 epochs, resulted in Top-1/Top-5 accuracies higher than that of the original model.   Last but not least, we implemented the convolutional shifts and fully connected shift GPU kernels and showed a reduction in latency time of 25% when inferring ResNet18 compared to unoptimized multiplication-based GPU kernels.

Title: An Ensemble of Simple Convolutional Neural Network Models for MNIST
  Digit Recognition
Abstract:
  We report that a very high accuracy on the MNIST test set can be achieved by using simple convolutional neural network (CNN) models. We use three different models with 3x3, 5x5, and 7x7 kernel size in the convolution layers. Each model consists of a set of convolution layers followed by a single fully connected layer. Every convolution layer uses batch normalization and ReLU activation, and pooling is not used. Rotation and translation is used to augment training data, which is frequently used in most image classification tasks. A majority voting using the three models independently trained on the training data set can achieve up to 99.87% accuracy on the test set, which is one of the state-of-the-art results. A two-layer ensemble, a heterogeneous ensemble of three homogeneous ensemble networks, can achieve up to 99.91% test accuracy. The results can be reproduced by using the code at: https://github.com/ansh941/MnistSimpleCNN

Title: Homogeneous Vector Capsules Enable Adaptive Gradient Descent in
  Convolutional Neural Networks
Abstract:
  Capsules are the name given by Geoffrey Hinton to vector-valued neurons. Neural networks traditionally produce a scalar value for an activated neuron. Capsules, on the other hand, produce a vector of values, which Hinton argues correspond to a single, composite feature wherein the values of the components of the vectors indicate properties of the feature such as transformation or contrast. We present a new way of parameterizing and training capsules that we refer to as homogeneous vector capsules (HVCs). We demonstrate, experimentally, that altering a convolutional neural network (CNN) to use HVCs can achieve superior classification accuracy without increasing the number of parameters or operations in its architecture as compared to a CNN using a single final fully connected layer. Additionally, the introduction of HVCs enables the use of adaptive gradient descent, reducing the dependence a model's achievable accuracy has on the finely tuned hyperparameters of a non-adaptive optimizer. We demonstrate our method and results using two neural network architectures. First, a very simple monolithic CNN that when using HVCs achieved a 63% improvement in top-1 classification accuracy and a 35% improvement in top-5 classification accuracy over the baseline architecture. Second, with the CNN architecture referred to as Inception v3 that achieved similar accuracies both with and without HVCs. Additionally, the simple monolithic CNN when using HVCs showed no overfitting after more than 300 epochs whereas the baseline showed overfitting after 30 epochs. We use the ImageNet ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge dataset with both networks.

Title: Classifying Variable-Length Audio Files with All-Convolutional Networks
  and Masked Global Pooling
Abstract:
  We trained a deep all-convolutional neural network with masked global pooling to perform single-label classification for acoustic scene classification and multi-label classification for domestic audio tagging in the DCASE-2016 contest. Our network achieved an average accuracy of 84.5% on the four-fold cross-validation for acoustic scene recognition, compared to the provided baseline of 72.5%, and an average equal error rate of 0.17 for domestic audio tagging, compared to the baseline of 0.21. The network therefore improves the baselines by a relative amount of 17% and 19%, respectively. The network only consists of convolutional layers to extract features from the short-time Fourier transform and one global pooling layer to combine those features. It particularly possesses neither fully-connected layers, besides the fully-connected output layer, nor dropout layers.

Title: Towards Dropout Training for Convolutional Neural Networks
Abstract:
  Recently, dropout has seen increasing use in deep learning. For deep convolutional neural networks, dropout is known to work well in fully-connected layers. However, its effect in convolutional and pooling layers is still not clear. This paper demonstrates that max-pooling dropout is equivalent to randomly picking activation based on a multinomial distribution at training time. In light of this insight, we advocate employing our proposed probabilistic weighted pooling, instead of commonly used max-pooling, to act as model averaging at test time. Empirical evidence validates the superiority of probabilistic weighted pooling. We also empirically show that the effect of convolutional dropout is not trivial, despite the dramatically reduced possibility of over-fitting due to the convolutional architecture. Elaborately designing dropout training simultaneously in max-pooling and fully-connected layers, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on MNIST, and very competitive results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, relative to other approaches without data augmentation. Finally, we compare max-pooling dropout and stochastic pooling, both of which introduce stochasticity based on multinomial distributions at pooling stage.

Title: Dilated Fully Convolutional Neural Network for Depth Estimation from a
  Single Image
Abstract:
  Depth prediction plays a key role in understanding a 3D scene. Several techniques have been developed throughout the years, among which Convolutional Neural Network has recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on estimating depth from a single image. However, traditional CNNs suffer from the lower resolution and information loss caused by the pooling layers. And oversized parameters generated from fully connected layers often lead to a exploded memory usage problem. In this paper, we present an advanced Dilated Fully Convolutional Neural Network to address the deficiencies. Taking advantages of the exponential expansion of the receptive field in dilated convolutions, our model can minimize the loss of resolution. It also reduces the amount of parameters significantly by replacing the fully connected layers with the fully convolutional layers. We show experimentally on NYU Depth V2 datasets that the depth prediction obtained from our model is considerably closer to ground truth than that from traditional CNNs techniques.

Title: Efficient Yet Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Semantic
  Segmentation
Abstract:
  Semantic Segmentation using deep convolutional neural network pose more complex challenge for any GPU intensive task. As it has to compute million of parameters, it results to huge memory consumption. Moreover, extracting finer features and conducting supervised training tends to increase the complexity. With the introduction of Fully Convolutional Neural Network, which uses finer strides and utilizes deconvolutional layers for upsampling, it has been a go to for any image segmentation task. In this paper, we propose two segmentation architecture which not only needs one-third the parameters to compute but also gives better accuracy than the similar architectures. The model weights were transferred from the popular neural net like VGG19 and VGG16 which were trained on Imagenet classification data-set. Then we transform all the fully connected layers to convolutional layers and use dilated convolution for decreasing the parameters. Lastly, we add finer strides and attach four skip architectures which are element-wise summed with the deconvolutional layers in steps. We train and test on different sparse and fine data-sets like Pascal VOC2012, Pascal-Context and NYUDv2 and show how better our model performs in this tasks. On the other hand our model has a faster inference time and consumes less memory for training and testing on NVIDIA Pascal GPUs, making it more efficient and less memory consuming architecture for pixel-wise segmentation.

Title: Training LSTM Networks with Resistive Cross-Point Devices
Abstract:
  In our previous work we have shown that resistive cross point devices, so called Resistive Processing Unit (RPU) devices, can provide significant power and speed benefits when training deep fully connected networks as well as convolutional neural networks. In this work, we further extend the RPU concept for training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) namely LSTMs. We show that the mapping of recurrent layers is very similar to the mapping of fully connected layers and therefore the RPU concept can potentially provide large acceleration factors for RNNs as well. In addition, we study the effect of various device imperfections and system parameters on training performance. Symmetry of updates becomes even more crucial for RNNs; already a few percent asymmetry results in an increase in the test error compared to the ideal case trained with floating point numbers. Furthermore, the input signal resolution to device arrays needs to be at least 7 bits for successful training. However, we show that a stochastic rounding scheme can reduce the input signal resolution back to 5 bits. Further, we find that RPU device variations and hardware noise are enough to mitigate overfitting, so that there is less need for using dropout. We note that the models trained here are roughly 1500 times larger than the fully connected network trained on MNIST dataset in terms of the total number of multiplication and summation operations performed per epoch. Thus, here we attempt to study the validity of the RPU approach for large scale networks.

Title: Striving for Simplicity: The All Convolutional Net
Abstract:
  Most modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used for object recognition are built using the same principles: Alternating convolution and max-pooling layers followed by a small number of fully connected layers. We re-evaluate the state of the art for object recognition from small images with convolutional networks, questioning the necessity of different components in the pipeline. We find that max-pooling can simply be replaced by a convolutional layer with increased stride without loss in accuracy on several image recognition benchmarks. Following this finding -- and building on other recent work for finding simple network structures -- we propose a new architecture that consists solely of convolutional layers and yields competitive or state of the art performance on several object recognition datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet). To analyze the network we introduce a new variant of the "deconvolution approach" for visualizing features learned by CNNs, which can be applied to a broader range of network structures than existing approaches.
