Title: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation of tomographic images in the
  diagnosis of stroke
Abstract:
  This paper presents an automatic algorithm for the segmentation of areas affected by an acute stroke on the non-contrast computed tomography brain images. The proposed algorithm is designed for learning in a weakly supervised scenario when some images are labeled accurately, and some images are labeled inaccurately. Wrong labels appear as a result of inaccuracy made by a radiologist in the process of manual annotation of computed tomography images. We propose methods for solving the segmentation problem in the case of inaccurately labeled training data. We use the U-Net neural network architecture with several modifications. Experiments on real computed tomography scans show that the proposed methods increase the segmentation accuracy.

Title: Deep learning for cardiac image segmentation: A review
Abstract:
  Deep learning has become the most widely used approach for cardiac image segmentation in recent years. In this paper, we provide a review of over 100 cardiac image segmentation papers using deep learning, which covers common imaging modalities including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound (US) and major anatomical structures of interest (ventricles, atria and vessels). In addition, a summary of publicly available cardiac image datasets and code repositories are included to provide a base for encouraging reproducible research. Finally, we discuss the challenges and limitations with current deep learning-based approaches (scarcity of labels, model generalizability across different domains, interpretability) and suggest potential directions for future research.

Title: Deep learning-based synthetic-CT generation in radiotherapy and PET: a
  review
Abstract:
  Recently, deep learning (DL)-based methods for the generation of synthetic computed tomography (sCT) have received significant research attention as an alternative to classical ones. We present here a systematic review of these methods by grouping them into three categories, according to their clinical applications: I) To replace CT in magnetic resonance (MR)-based treatment planning. II) Facilitate cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT)-based image-guided adaptive radiotherapy. III) Derive attenuation maps for the correction of positron emission tomography (PET). Appropriate database searching was performed on journal articles published between January 2014 and December 2020. The DL methods' key characteristics were extracted from each eligible study, and a comprehensive comparison among network architectures and metrics was reported. A detailed review of each category was given, highlighting essential contributions, identifying specific challenges, and summarising the achievements. Lastly, the statistics of all the cited works from various aspects were analysed, revealing the popularity and future trends, and the potential of DL-based sCT generation. The current status of DL-based sCT generation was evaluated, assessing the clinical readiness of the presented methods.

Title: Human Treelike Tubular Structure Segmentation: A Comprehensive Review
  and Future Perspectives
Abstract:
  Various structures in human physiology follow a treelike morphology, which often expresses complexity at very fine scales. Examples of such structures are intrathoracic airways, retinal blood vessels, and hepatic blood vessels. Large collections of 2D and 3D images have been made available by medical imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and ultrasound in which the spatial arrangement can be observed. Segmentation of these structures in medical imaging is of great importance since the analysis of the structure provides insights into disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and prognosis. Manually labelling extensive data by radiologists is often time-consuming and error-prone. As a result, automated or semi-automated computational models have become a popular research field of medical imaging in the past two decades, and many have been developed to date. In this survey, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of currently publicly available datasets, segmentation algorithms, and evaluation metrics. In addition, current challenges and future research directions are discussed.

Title: Radiological images and machine learning: trends, perspectives, and
  prospects
Abstract:
  The application of machine learning to radiological images is an increasingly active research area that is expected to grow in the next five to ten years. Recent advances in machine learning have the potential to recognize and classify complex patterns from different radiological imaging modalities such as x-rays, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography imaging. In many applications, machine learning based systems have shown comparable performance to human decision-making. The applications of machine learning are the key ingredients of future clinical decision making and monitoring systems. This review covers the fundamental concepts behind various machine learning techniques and their applications in several radiological imaging areas, such as medical image segmentation, brain function studies and neurological disease diagnosis, as well as computer-aided systems, image registration, and content-based image retrieval systems. Synchronistically, we will briefly discuss current challenges and future directions regarding the application of machine learning in radiological imaging. By giving insight on how take advantage of machine learning powered applications, we expect that clinicians can prevent and diagnose diseases more accurately and efficiently.

Title: Exploring Vanilla U-Net for Lesion Segmentation from Whole-body
  FDG-PET/CT Scans
Abstract:
  Tumor lesion segmentation is one of the most important tasks in medical image analysis. In clinical practice, Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron-Emission Tomography~(FDG-PET) is a widely used technique to identify and quantify metabolically active tumors. However, since FDG-PET scans only provide metabolic information, healthy tissue or benign disease with irregular glucose consumption may be mistaken for cancer. To handle this challenge, PET is commonly combined with Computed Tomography~(CT), with the CT used to obtain the anatomic structure of the patient. The combination of PET-based metabolic and CT-based anatomic information can contribute to better tumor segmentation results. %Computed tomography~(CT) is a popular modality to illustrate the anatomic structure of the patient. The combination of PET and CT is promising to handle this challenge by utilizing metabolic and anatomic information. In this paper, we explore the potential of U-Net for lesion segmentation in whole-body FDG-PET/CT scans from three aspects, including network architecture, data preprocessing, and data augmentation. The experimental results demonstrate that the vanilla U-Net with proper input shape can achieve satisfactory performance. Specifically, our method achieves first place in both preliminary and final leaderboards of the autoPET 2022 challenge. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yejin0111/autoPET2022_Blackbean.

Title: Convolutional Neural Network for Early Pulmonary Embolism Detection via
  Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography
Abstract:
  This study was conducted to develop a computer-aided detection (CAD) system for triaging patients with pulmonary embolism (PE). The purpose of the system was to reduce the death rate during the waiting period. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is used for PE diagnosis. Because CTPA reports require a radiologist to review the case and suggest further management, this creates a waiting period during which patients may die. Our proposed CAD method was thus designed to triage patients with PE from those without PE. In contrast to related studies involving CAD systems that identify key PE lesion images to expedite PE diagnosis, our system comprises a novel classification-model ensemble for PE detection and a segmentation model for PE lesion labeling. The models were trained using data from National Cheng Kung University Hospital and open resources. The classification model yielded 0.73 for receiver operating characteristic curve (accuracy = 0.85), while the mean intersection over union was 0.689 for the segmentation model. The proposed CAD system can distinguish between patients with and without PE and automatically label PE lesions to expedite PE diagnosis

Title: Acute ischemic stroke lesion segmentation in non-contrast CT images
  using 3D convolutional neural networks
Abstract:
  In this paper, an automatic algorithm aimed at volumetric segmentation of acute ischemic stroke lesion in non-contrast computed tomography brain 3D images is proposed. Our deep-learning approach is based on the popular 3D U-Net convolutional neural network architecture, which was modified by adding the squeeze-and-excitation blocks and residual connections. Robust pre-processing methods were implemented to improve the segmentation accuracy. Moreover, a specific patches sampling strategy was used to address the large size of medical images, to smooth out the effect of the class imbalance problem and to stabilize neural network training. All experiments were performed using five-fold cross-validation on the dataset containing non-contrast computed tomography volumetric brain scans of 81 patients diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke. Two radiology experts manually segmented images independently and then verified the labeling results for inconsistencies. The quantitative results of the proposed algorithm and obtained segmentation were measured by the Dice similarity coefficient, sensitivity, specificity and precision metrics. Our proposed model achieves an average Dice of $0.628\pm0.033$, sensitivity of $0.699\pm0.039$, specificity of $0.9965\pm0.0016$ and precision of $0.619\pm0.036$, showing promising segmentation results.

Title: Whole-Body Lesion Segmentation in 18F-FDG PET/CT
Abstract:
  There has been growing research interest in using deep learning based method to achieve fully automated segmentation of lesion in Positron emission tomography computed tomography(PET CT) scans for the prognosis of various cancers. Recent advances in the medical image segmentation shows the nnUNET is feasible for diverse tasks. However, lesion segmentation in the PET images is not straightforward, because lesion and physiological uptake has similar distribution patterns. The Distinction of them requires extra structural information in the CT images. The present paper introduces a nnUNet based method for the lesion segmentation task. The proposed model is designed on the basis of the joint 2D and 3D nnUNET architecture to predict lesions across the whole body. It allows for automated segmentation of potential lesions. We evaluate the proposed method in the context of AutoPet Challenge, which measures the lesion segmentation performance in the metrics of dice score, false-positive volume and false-negative volume.
