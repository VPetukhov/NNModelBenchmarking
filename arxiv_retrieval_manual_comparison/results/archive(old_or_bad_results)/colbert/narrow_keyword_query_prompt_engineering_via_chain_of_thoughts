Condition Monitoring of HV Bushings in the Presence of Missing Data
  Using Evolutionary Computing
  The work proposes the application of neural networks with particle swarm
optimisation (PSO) and genetic algorithms (GA) to compensate for missing data
in classifying high voltage bushings. The classification is done using DGA data
from 60966 bushings based on IEEEc57.104, IEC599 and IEEE production rates
methods for oil impregnated paper (OIP) bushings. PSO and GA were compared in
terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. Both GA and PSO simulations
were able to estimate missing data values to an average 95% accuracy when only
one variable was missing. However PSO rapidly deteriorated to 66% accuracy with
two variables missing simultaneously, compared to 84% for GA. The data
estimated using GA was found to classify the conditions of bushings than the
PSO.

Evolving Symbolic Controllers
  The idea of symbolic controllers tries to bridge the gap between the top-down
manual design of the controller architecture, as advocated in Brooks'
subsumption architecture, and the bottom-up designer-free approach that is now
standard within the Evolutionary Robotics community. The designer provides a
set of elementary behavior, and evolution is given the goal of assembling them
to solve complex tasks. Two experiments are presented, demonstrating the
efficiency and showing the recursiveness of this approach. In particular, the
sensitivity with respect to the proposed elementary behaviors, and the
robustness w.r.t. generalization of the resulting controllers are studied in
detail.

Using artificial intelligence for data reduction in mechanical
  engineering
  In this paper artificial neural networks and support vector machines are used
to reduce the amount of vibration data that is required to estimate the Time
Domain Average of a gear vibration signal. Two models for estimating the time
domain average of a gear vibration signal are proposed. The models are tested
on data from an accelerated gear life test rig. Experimental results indicate
that the required data for calculating the Time Domain Average of a gear
vibration signal can be reduced by up to 75% when the proposed models are
implemented.

Architecture for Pseudo Acausal Evolvable Embedded Systems
  Advances in semiconductor technology are contributing to the increasing
complexity in the design of embedded systems. Architectures with novel
techniques such as evolvable nature and autonomous behavior have engrossed lot
of attention. This paper demonstrates conceptually evolvable embedded systems
can be characterized basing on acausal nature. It is noted that in acausal
systems, future input needs to be known, here we make a mechanism such that the
system predicts the future inputs and exhibits pseudo acausal nature. An
embedded system that uses theoretical framework of acausality is proposed. Our
method aims at a novel architecture that features the hardware evolability and
autonomous behavior alongside pseudo acausality. Various aspects of this
architecture are discussed in detail along with the limitations.

Multi-Dimensional Recurrent Neural Networks
  Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have proved effective at one dimensional
sequence learning tasks, such as speech and online handwriting recognition.
Some of the properties that make RNNs suitable for such tasks, for example
robustness to input warping, and the ability to access contextual information,
are also desirable in multidimensional domains. However, there has so far been
no direct way of applying RNNs to data with more than one spatio-temporal
dimension. This paper introduces multi-dimensional recurrent neural networks
(MDRNNs), thereby extending the potential applicability of RNNs to vision,
video processing, medical imaging and many other areas, while avoiding the
scaling problems that have plagued other multi-dimensional models. Experimental
results are provided for two image segmentation tasks.
