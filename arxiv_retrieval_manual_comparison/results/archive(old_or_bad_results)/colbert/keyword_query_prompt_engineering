On the Development of Text Input Method - Lessons Learned
  Intelligent Input Methods (IM) are essential for making text entries in many
East Asian scripts, but their application to other languages has not been fully
explored. This paper discusses how such tools can contribute to the development
of computer processing of other oriental languages. We propose a design
philosophy that regards IM as a text service platform, and treats the study of
IM as a cross disciplinary subject from the perspectives of software
engineering, human-computer interaction (HCI), and natural language processing
(NLP). We discuss these three perspectives and indicate a number of possible
future research directions.

Exploiting Social Annotation for Automatic Resource Discovery
  Information integration applications, such as mediators or mashups, that
require access to information resources currently rely on users manually
discovering and integrating them in the application. Manual resource discovery
is a slow process, requiring the user to sift through results obtained via
keyword-based search. Although search methods have advanced to include evidence
from document contents, its metadata and the contents and link structure of the
referring pages, they still do not adequately cover information sources --
often called ``the hidden Web''-- that dynamically generate documents in
response to a query. The recently popular social bookmarking sites, which allow
users to annotate and share metadata about various information sources, provide
rich evidence for resource discovery. In this paper, we describe a
probabilistic model of the user annotation process in a social bookmarking
system del.icio.us. We then use the model to automatically find resources
relevant to a particular information domain. Our experimental results on data
obtained from \emph{del.icio.us} show this approach as a promising method for
helping automate the resource discovery task.

Evolving Symbolic Controllers
  The idea of symbolic controllers tries to bridge the gap between the top-down
manual design of the controller architecture, as advocated in Brooks'
subsumption architecture, and the bottom-up designer-free approach that is now
standard within the Evolutionary Robotics community. The designer provides a
set of elementary behavior, and evolution is given the goal of assembling them
to solve complex tasks. Two experiments are presented, demonstrating the
efficiency and showing the recursiveness of this approach. In particular, the
sensitivity with respect to the proposed elementary behaviors, and the
robustness w.r.t. generalization of the resulting controllers are studied in
detail.

Architecture for Pseudo Acausal Evolvable Embedded Systems
  Advances in semiconductor technology are contributing to the increasing
complexity in the design of embedded systems. Architectures with novel
techniques such as evolvable nature and autonomous behavior have engrossed lot
of attention. This paper demonstrates conceptually evolvable embedded systems
can be characterized basing on acausal nature. It is noted that in acausal
systems, future input needs to be known, here we make a mechanism such that the
system predicts the future inputs and exhibits pseudo acausal nature. An
embedded system that uses theoretical framework of acausality is proposed. Our
method aims at a novel architecture that features the hardware evolability and
autonomous behavior alongside pseudo acausality. Various aspects of this
architecture are discussed in detail along with the limitations.

Structural Health Monitoring Using Neural Network Based Vibrational
  System Identification
  Composite fabrication technologies now provide the means for producing
high-strength, low-weight panels, plates, spars and other structural components
which use embedded fiber optic sensors and piezoelectric transducers. These
materials, often referred to as smart structures, make it possible to sense
internal characteristics, such as delaminations or structural degradation. In
this effort we use neural network based techniques for modeling and analyzing
dynamic structural information for recognizing structural defects. This yields
an adaptable system which gives a measure of structural integrity for composite
structures.
