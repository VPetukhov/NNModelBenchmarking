Title: Generative Adversarial Networks and Adversarial Autoencoders: Tutorial
  and Survey
Abstract:
  This is a tutorial and survey paper on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), adversarial autoencoders, and their variants. We start with explaining adversarial learning and the vanilla GAN. Then, we explain the conditional GAN and DCGAN. The mode collapse problem is introduced and various methods, including minibatch GAN, unrolled GAN, BourGAN, mixture GAN, D2GAN, and Wasserstein GAN, are introduced for resolving this problem. Then, maximum likelihood estimation in GAN are explained along with f-GAN, adversarial variational Bayes, and Bayesian GAN. Then, we cover feature matching in GAN, InfoGAN, GRAN, LSGAN, energy-based GAN, CatGAN, MMD GAN, LapGAN, progressive GAN, triple GAN, LAG, GMAN, AdaGAN, CoGAN, inverse GAN, BiGAN, ALI, SAGAN, Few-shot GAN, SinGAN, and interpolation and evaluation of GAN. Then, we introduce some applications of GAN such as image-to-image translation (including PatchGAN, CycleGAN, DeepFaceDrawing, simulated GAN, interactive GAN), text-to-image translation (including StackGAN), and mixing image characteristics (including FineGAN and MixNMatch). Finally, we explain the autoencoders based on adversarial learning including adversarial autoencoder, PixelGAN, and implicit autoencoder.

Title: Loss-Sensitive Generative Adversarial Networks on Lipschitz Densities
Abstract:
  In this paper, we present the Lipschitz regularization theory and algorithms for a novel Loss-Sensitive Generative Adversarial Network (LS-GAN). Specifically, it trains a loss function to distinguish between real and fake samples by designated margins, while learning a generator alternately to produce realistic samples by minimizing their losses. The LS-GAN further regularizes its loss function with a Lipschitz regularity condition on the density of real data, yielding a regularized model that can better generalize to produce new data from a reasonable number of training examples than the classic GAN. We will further present a Generalized LS-GAN (GLS-GAN) and show it contains a large family of regularized GAN models, including both LS-GAN and Wasserstein GAN, as its special cases. Compared with the other GAN models, we will conduct experiments to show both LS-GAN and GLS-GAN exhibit competitive ability in generating new images in terms of the Minimum Reconstruction Error (MRE) assessed on a separate test set. We further extend the LS-GAN to a conditional form for supervised and semi-supervised learning problems, and demonstrate its outstanding performance on image classification tasks.

Title: How Generative Adversarial Networks and Their Variants Work: An Overview
Abstract:
  Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have received wide attention in the machine learning field for their potential to learn high-dimensional, complex real data distribution. Specifically, they do not rely on any assumptions about the distribution and can generate real-like samples from latent space in a simple manner. This powerful property leads GAN to be applied to various applications such as image synthesis, image attribute editing, image translation, domain adaptation and other academic fields. In this paper, we aim to discuss the details of GAN for those readers who are familiar with, but do not comprehend GAN deeply or who wish to view GAN from various perspectives. In addition, we explain how GAN operates and the fundamental meaning of various objective functions that have been suggested recently. We then focus on how the GAN can be combined with an autoencoder framework. Finally, we enumerate the GAN variants that are applied to various tasks and other fields for those who are interested in exploiting GAN for their research.

Title: Softmax GAN
Abstract:
  Softmax GAN is a novel variant of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The key idea of Softmax GAN is to replace the classification loss in the original GAN with a softmax cross-entropy loss in the sample space of one single batch. In the adversarial learning of $N$ real training samples and $M$ generated samples, the target of discriminator training is to distribute all the probability mass to the real samples, each with probability $\frac{1}{M}$, and distribute zero probability to generated data. In the generator training phase, the target is to assign equal probability to all data points in the batch, each with probability $\frac{1}{M+N}$. While the original GAN is closely related to Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE), we show that Softmax GAN is the Importance Sampling version of GAN. We futher demonstrate with experiments that this simple change stabilizes GAN training.

Title: Dihedral angle prediction using generative adversarial networks
Abstract:
  Several dihedral angles prediction methods were developed for protein structure prediction and their other applications. However, distribution of predicted angles would not be similar to that of real angles. To address this we employed generative adversarial networks (GAN). Generative adversarial networks are composed of two adversarially trained networks: a discriminator and a generator. A discriminator distinguishes samples from a dataset and generated samples while a generator generates realistic samples. Although the discriminator of GANs is trained to estimate density, GAN model is intractable. On the other hand, noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) was introduced to estimate a normalization constant of an unnormalized statistical model and thus the density function. In this thesis, we introduce noise-contrastive estimation generative adversarial networks (NCE-GAN) which enables explicit density estimation of a GAN model. And a new loss for the generator is proposed. We also propose residue-wise variants of auxiliary classifier GAN (AC-GAN) and Semi-supervised GAN to handle sequence information in a window. In our experiment, the conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN), AC-GAN and Semi-supervised GAN were compared. And experiments done with improved conditions were invested. We identified a phenomenon of AC-GAN that distribution of its predicted angles is composed of unusual clusters. The distribution of the predicted angles of Semi-supervised GAN was most similar to the Ramachandran plot. We found that adding the output of the NCE as an additional input of the discriminator is helpful to stabilize the training of the GANs and to capture the detailed structures. Adding regression loss and using predicted angles by regression loss only model could improve the conditional generation performance of the C-GAN and AC-GAN.

Title: SPA-GAN: Spatial Attention GAN for Image-to-Image Translation
Abstract:
  Image-to-image translation is to learn a mapping between images from a source domain and images from a target domain. In this paper, we introduce the attention mechanism directly to the generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture and propose a novel spatial attention GAN model (SPA-GAN) for image-to-image translation tasks. SPA-GAN computes the attention in its discriminator and use it to help the generator focus more on the most discriminative regions between the source and target domains, leading to more realistic output images. We also find it helpful to introduce an additional feature map loss in SPA-GAN training to preserve domain specific features during translation. Compared with existing attention-guided GAN models, SPA-GAN is a lightweight model that does not need additional attention networks or supervision. Qualitative and quantitative comparison against state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets demonstrates the superior performance of SPA-GAN.

Title: GAN Inversion: A Survey
Abstract:
  GAN inversion aims to invert a given image back into the latent space of a pretrained GAN model, for the image to be faithfully reconstructed from the inverted code by the generator. As an emerging technique to bridge the real and fake image domains, GAN inversion plays an essential role in enabling the pretrained GAN models such as StyleGAN and BigGAN to be used for real image editing applications. Meanwhile, GAN inversion also provides insights on the interpretation of GAN's latent space and how the realistic images can be generated. In this paper, we provide an overview of GAN inversion with a focus on its recent algorithms and applications. We cover important techniques of GAN inversion and their applications to image restoration and image manipulation. We further elaborate on some trends and challenges for future directions.

Title: Twin Auxiliary Classifiers GAN
Abstract:
  Conditional generative models enjoy remarkable progress over the past few years. One of the popular conditional models is Auxiliary Classifier GAN (AC-GAN), which generates highly discriminative images by extending the loss function of GAN with an auxiliary classifier. However, the diversity of the generated samples by AC-GAN tends to decrease as the number of classes increases, hence limiting its power on large-scale data. In this paper, we identify the source of the low diversity issue theoretically and propose a practical solution to solve the problem. We show that the auxiliary classifier in AC-GAN imposes perfect separability, which is disadvantageous when the supports of the class distributions have significant overlap. To address the issue, we propose Twin Auxiliary Classifiers Generative Adversarial Net (TAC-GAN) that further benefits from a new player that interacts with other players (the generator and the discriminator) in GAN. Theoretically, we demonstrate that TAC-GAN can effectively minimize the divergence between the generated and real-data distributions. Extensive experimental results show that our TAC-GAN can successfully replicate the true data distributions on simulated data, and significantly improves the diversity of class-conditional image generation on real datasets.

Title: Conditional GANs For Painting Generation
Abstract:
  We examined the use of modern Generative Adversarial Nets to generate novel images of oil paintings using the Painter By Numbers dataset. We implemented Spectral Normalization GAN (SN-GAN) and Spectral Normalization GAN with Gradient Penalty, and compared their outputs to a Deep Convolutional GAN. Visually, and quantitatively according to the Sliced Wasserstein Distance metric, we determined that the SN-GAN produced paintings that were most comparable to our training dataset. We then performed a series of experiments to add supervised conditioning to SN-GAN, the culmination of which is what we believe to be a novel architecture that can generate face paintings with user-specified characteristics.

Title: On Data Augmentation for GAN Training
Abstract:
  Recent successes in Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have affirmed the importance of using more data in GAN training. Yet it is expensive to collect data in many domains such as medical applications. Data Augmentation (DA) has been applied in these applications. In this work, we first argue that the classical DA approach could mislead the generator to learn the distribution of the augmented data, which could be different from that of the original data. We then propose a principled framework, termed Data Augmentation Optimized for GAN (DAG), to enable the use of augmented data in GAN training to improve the learning of the original distribution. We provide theoretical analysis to show that using our proposed DAG aligns with the original GAN in minimizing the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence between the original distribution and model distribution. Importantly, the proposed DAG effectively leverages the augmented data to improve the learning of discriminator and generator. We conduct experiments to apply DAG to different GAN models: unconditional GAN, conditional GAN, self-supervised GAN and CycleGAN using datasets of natural images and medical images. The results show that DAG achieves consistent and considerable improvements across these models. Furthermore, when DAG is used in some GAN models, the system establishes state-of-the-art Frechet Inception Distance (FID) scores. Our code is available.
