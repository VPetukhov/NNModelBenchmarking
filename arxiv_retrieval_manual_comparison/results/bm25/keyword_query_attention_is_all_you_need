Title: Attention Interpretability Across NLP Tasks
Abstract:
  The attention layer in a neural network model provides insights into the model's reasoning behind its prediction, which are usually criticized for being opaque. Recently, seemingly contradictory viewpoints have emerged about the interpretability of attention weights (Jain & Wallace, 2019; Vig & Belinkov, 2019). Amid such confusion arises the need to understand attention mechanism more systematically. In this work, we attempt to fill this gap by giving a comprehensive explanation which justifies both kinds of observations (i.e., when is attention interpretable and when it is not). Through a series of experiments on diverse NLP tasks, we validate our observations and reinforce our claim of interpretability of attention through manual evaluation.

Title: Transformer with Fourier Integral Attentions
Abstract:
  Multi-head attention empowers the recent success of transformers, the state-of-the-art models that have achieved remarkable success in sequence modeling and beyond. These attention mechanisms compute the pairwise dot products between the queries and keys, which results from the use of unnormalized Gaussian kernels with the assumption that the queries follow a mixture of Gaussian distribution. There is no guarantee that this assumption is valid in practice. In response, we first interpret attention in transformers as a nonparametric kernel regression. We then propose the FourierFormer, a new class of transformers in which the dot-product kernels are replaced by the novel generalized Fourier integral kernels. Different from the dot-product kernels, where we need to choose a good covariance matrix to capture the dependency of the features of data, the generalized Fourier integral kernels can automatically capture such dependency and remove the need to tune the covariance matrix. We theoretically prove that our proposed Fourier integral kernels can efficiently approximate any key and query distributions. Compared to the conventional transformers with dot-product attention, FourierFormers attain better accuracy and reduce the redundancy between attention heads. We empirically corroborate the advantages of FourierFormers over the baseline transformers in a variety of practical applications including language modeling and image classification.

Title: Attention Guided Anomaly Localization in Images
Abstract:
  Anomaly localization is an important problem in computer vision which involves localizing anomalous regions within images with applications in industrial inspection, surveillance, and medical imaging. This task is challenging due to the small sample size and pixel coverage of the anomaly in real-world scenarios. Most prior works need to use anomalous training images to compute a class-specific threshold to localize anomalies. Without the need of anomalous training images, we propose Convolutional Adversarial Variational autoencoder with Guided Attention (CAVGA), which localizes the anomaly with a convolutional latent variable to preserve the spatial information. In the unsupervised setting, we propose an attention expansion loss where we encourage CAVGA to focus on all normal regions in the image. Furthermore, in the weakly-supervised setting we propose a complementary guided attention loss, where we encourage the attention map to focus on all normal regions while minimizing the attention map corresponding to anomalous regions in the image. CAVGA outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) anomaly localization methods on MVTec Anomaly Detection (MVTAD), modified ShanghaiTech Campus (mSTC) and Large-scale Attention based Glaucoma (LAG) datasets in the unsupervised setting and when using only 2% anomalous images in the weakly-supervised setting. CAVGA also outperforms SOTA anomaly detection methods on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, Fashion-MNIST, MVTAD, mSTC and LAG datasets.

Title: Switchable Self-attention Module
Abstract:
  Attention mechanism has gained great success in vision recognition. Many works are devoted to improving the effectiveness of attention mechanism, which finely design the structure of the attention operator. These works need lots of experiments to pick out the optimal settings when scenarios change, which consumes a lot of time and computational resources. In addition, a neural network often contains many network layers, and most studies often use the same attention module to enhance different network layers, which hinders the further improvement of the performance of the self-attention mechanism. To address the above problems, we propose a self-attention module SEM. Based on the input information of the attention module and alternative attention operators, SEM can automatically decide to select and integrate attention operators to compute attention maps. The effectiveness of SEM is demonstrated by extensive experiments on widely used benchmark datasets and popular self-attention networks.

Title: Exploiting Inductive Bias in Transformers for Unsupervised
  Disentanglement of Syntax and Semantics with VAEs
Abstract:
  We propose a generative model for text generation, which exhibits disentangled latent representations of syntax and semantics. Contrary to previous work, this model does not need syntactic information such as constituency parses, or semantic information such as paraphrase pairs. Our model relies solely on the inductive bias found in attention-based architectures such as Transformers.   In the attention of Transformers, keys handle information selection while values specify what information is conveyed. Our model, dubbed QKVAE, uses Attention in its decoder to read latent variables where one latent variable infers keys while another infers values. We run experiments on latent representations and experiments on syntax/semantics transfer which show that QKVAE displays clear signs of disentangled syntax and semantics. We also show that our model displays competitive syntax transfer capabilities when compared to supervised models and that comparable supervised models need a fairly large amount of data (more than 50K samples) to outperform it on both syntactic and semantic transfer. The code for our experiments is publicly available.

Title: Efficient Attention using a Fixed-Size Memory Representation
Abstract:
  The standard content-based attention mechanism typically used in sequence-to-sequence models is computationally expensive as it requires the comparison of large encoder and decoder states at each time step. In this work, we propose an alternative attention mechanism based on a fixed size memory representation that is more efficient. Our technique predicts a compact set of K attention contexts during encoding and lets the decoder compute an efficient lookup that does not need to consult the memory. We show that our approach performs on-par with the standard attention mechanism while yielding inference speedups of 20% for real-world translation tasks and more for tasks with longer sequences. By visualizing attention scores we demonstrate that our models learn distinct, meaningful alignments.

Title: Influence Patterns for Explaining Information Flow in BERT
Abstract:
  While attention is all you need may be proving true, we do not know why: attention-based transformer models such as BERT are superior but how information flows from input tokens to output predictions are unclear. We introduce influence patterns, abstractions of sets of paths through a transformer model. Patterns quantify and localize the flow of information to paths passing through a sequence of model nodes. Experimentally, we find that significant portion of information flow in BERT goes through skip connections instead of attention heads. We further show that consistency of patterns across instances is an indicator of BERT's performance. Finally, We demonstrate that patterns account for far more model performance than previous attention-based and layer-based methods.

Title: Sharpen Focus: Learning with Attention Separability and Consistency
Abstract:
  Recent developments in gradient-based attention modeling have seen attention maps emerge as a powerful tool for interpreting convolutional neural networks. Despite good localization for an individual class of interest, these techniques produce attention maps with substantially overlapping responses among different classes, leading to the problem of visual confusion and the need for discriminative attention. In this paper, we address this problem by means of a new framework that makes class-discriminative attention a principled part of the learning process. Our key innovations include new learning objectives for attention separability and cross-layer consistency, which result in improved attention discriminability and reduced visual confusion. Extensive experiments on image classification benchmarks show the effectiveness of our approach in terms of improved classification accuracy, including CIFAR-100 (+3.33%), Caltech-256 (+1.64%), ILSVRC2012 (+0.92%), CUB-200-2011 (+4.8%) and PASCAL VOC2012 (+5.73%).

Title: Convolutional Xformers for Vision
Abstract:
  Vision transformers (ViTs) have found only limited practical use in processing images, in spite of their state-of-the-art accuracy on certain benchmarks. The reason for their limited use include their need for larger training datasets and more computational resources compared to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), owing to the quadratic complexity of their self-attention mechanism. We propose a linear attention-convolution hybrid architecture -- Convolutional X-formers for Vision (CXV) -- to overcome these limitations. We replace the quadratic attention with linear attention mechanisms, such as Performer, Nystr\"omformer, and Linear Transformer, to reduce its GPU usage. Inductive prior for image data is provided by convolutional sub-layers, thereby eliminating the need for class token and positional embeddings used by the ViTs. We also propose a new training method where we use two different optimizers during different phases of training and show that it improves the top-1 image classification accuracy across different architectures. CXV outperforms other architectures, token mixers (e.g. ConvMixer, FNet and MLP Mixer), transformer models (e.g. ViT, CCT, CvT and hybrid Xformers), and ResNets for image classification in scenarios with limited data and GPU resources (cores, RAM, power).

Title: Improving Tree-LSTM with Tree Attention
Abstract:
  In Natural Language Processing (NLP), we often need to extract information from tree topology. Sentence structure can be represented via a dependency tree or a constituency tree structure. For this reason, a variant of LSTMs, named Tree-LSTM, was proposed to work on tree topology. In this paper, we design a generalized attention framework for both dependency and constituency trees by encoding variants of decomposable attention inside a Tree-LSTM cell. We evaluated our models on a semantic relatedness task and achieved notable results compared to Tree-LSTM based methods with no attention as well as other neural and non-neural methods and good results compared to Tree-LSTM based methods with attention.
