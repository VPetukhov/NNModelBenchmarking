Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Conversational AI
Abstract:
  Deep reinforcement learning is revolutionizing the artificial intelligence field. Currently, it serves as a good starting point for constructing intelligent autonomous systems which offer a better knowledge of the visual world. It is possible to scale deep reinforcement learning with the use of deep learning and do amazing tasks such as use of pixels in playing video games. In this paper, key concepts of deep reinforcement learning including reward function, differences between reinforcement learning and supervised learning and models for implementation of reinforcement are discussed. Key challenges related to the implementation of reinforcement learning in conversational AI domain are identified as well as discussed in detail. Various conversational models which are based on deep reinforcement learning (as well as deep learning) are also discussed. In summary, this paper discusses key aspects of deep reinforcement learning which are crucial for designing an efficient conversational AI.

Title: Group-Agent Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:
  It can largely benefit the reinforcement learning process of each agent if multiple agents perform their separate reinforcement learning tasks cooperatively. Different from multi-agent reinforcement learning where multiple agents are in a common environment and should learn to cooperate or compete with each other, in this case each agent has its separate environment and only communicate with others to share knowledge without any cooperative or competitive behaviour as a learning outcome. In fact, this learning scenario is not well understood yet and not well formulated. As the first effort, we propose group-agent reinforcement learning as a formulation of this scenario and the third type of reinforcement learning problem with respect to single-agent and multi-agent reinforcement learning. We then propose the first distributed reinforcement learning framework called DDAL (Decentralised Distributed Asynchronous Learning) designed for group-agent reinforcement learning. We show through experiments that DDAL achieved desirable performance with very stable training and has good scalability.

Title: Distributed Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey and A Multi-Player
  Multi-Agent Learning Toolbox
Abstract:
  With the breakthrough of AlphaGo, deep reinforcement learning becomes a recognized technique for solving sequential decision-making problems. Despite its reputation, data inefficiency caused by its trial and error learning mechanism makes deep reinforcement learning hard to be practical in a wide range of areas. Plenty of methods have been developed for sample efficient deep reinforcement learning, such as environment modeling, experience transfer, and distributed modifications, amongst which, distributed deep reinforcement learning has shown its potential in various applications, such as human-computer gaming, and intelligent transportation. In this paper, we conclude the state of this exciting field, by comparing the classical distributed deep reinforcement learning methods, and studying important components to achieve efficient distributed learning, covering single player single agent distributed deep reinforcement learning to the most complex multiple players multiple agents distributed deep reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we review recently released toolboxes that help to realize distributed deep reinforcement learning without many modifications of their non-distributed versions. By analyzing their strengths and weaknesses, a multi-player multi-agent distributed deep reinforcement learning toolbox is developed and released, which is further validated on Wargame, a complex environment, showing usability of the proposed toolbox for multiple players and multiple agents distributed deep reinforcement learning under complex games. Finally, we try to point out challenges and future trends, hoping this brief review can provide a guide or a spark for researchers who are interested in distributed deep reinforcement learning.

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning in Computer Vision: A Comprehensive Survey
Abstract:
  Deep reinforcement learning augments the reinforcement learning framework and utilizes the powerful representation of deep neural networks. Recent works have demonstrated the remarkable successes of deep reinforcement learning in various domains including finance, medicine, healthcare, video games, robotics, and computer vision. In this work, we provide a detailed review of recent and state-of-the-art research advances of deep reinforcement learning in computer vision. We start with comprehending the theories of deep learning, reinforcement learning, and deep reinforcement learning. We then propose a categorization of deep reinforcement learning methodologies and discuss their advantages and limitations. In particular, we divide deep reinforcement learning into seven main categories according to their applications in computer vision, i.e. (i)landmark localization (ii) object detection; (iii) object tracking; (iv) registration on both 2D image and 3D image volumetric data (v) image segmentation; (vi) videos analysis; and (vii) other applications. Each of these categories is further analyzed with reinforcement learning techniques, network design, and performance. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the existing publicly available datasets and examine source code availability. Finally, we present some open issues and discuss future research directions on deep reinforcement learning in computer vision

Title: Transfer Learning in Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey
Abstract:
  Reinforcement learning is a learning paradigm for solving sequential decision-making problems. Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in reinforcement learning upon the fast development of deep neural networks. Along with the promising prospects of reinforcement learning in numerous domains such as robotics and game-playing, transfer learning has arisen to tackle various challenges faced by reinforcement learning, by transferring knowledge from external expertise to facilitate the efficiency and effectiveness of the learning process. In this survey, we systematically investigate the recent progress of transfer learning approaches in the context of deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, we provide a framework for categorizing the state-of-the-art transfer learning approaches, under which we analyze their goals, methodologies, compatible reinforcement learning backbones, and practical applications. We also draw connections between transfer learning and other relevant topics from the reinforcement learning perspective and explore their potential challenges that await future research progress.

Title: Lineage Evolution Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:
  We propose a general agent population learning system, and on this basis, we propose lineage evolution reinforcement learning algorithm. Lineage evolution reinforcement learning is a kind of derivative algorithm which accords with the general agent population learning system. We take the agents in DQN and its related variants as the basic agents in the population, and add the selection, mutation and crossover modules in the genetic algorithm to the reinforcement learning algorithm. In the process of agent evolution, we refer to the characteristics of natural genetic behavior, add lineage factor to ensure the retention of potential performance of agent, and comprehensively consider the current performance and lineage value when evaluating the performance of agent. Without changing the parameters of the original reinforcement learning algorithm, lineage evolution reinforcement learning can optimize different reinforcement learning algorithms. Our experiments show that the idea of evolution with lineage improves the performance of original reinforcement learning algorithm in some games in Atari 2600.

Title: A Survey on Reinforcement Learning for Combinatorial Optimization
Abstract:
  This paper gives a detailed review of reinforcement learning in combinatorial optimization, introduces the history of combinatorial optimization starting in the 1960s, and compares it with the reinforcement learning algorithms in recent years. We explicitly look at a famous combinatorial problem known as the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). We compare the approach of the modern reinforcement learning algorithms on TSP with an approach published in 1970. Then, we discuss the similarities between these algorithms and how the approach of reinforcement learning changes due to the evolution of machine learning techniques and computing power. We also mention the deep learning approach on the TSP, which is named Deep Reinforcement Learning. We argue that deep learning is a generic approach that can be integrated with traditional reinforcement learning algorithms and optimize the outcomes of the TSP.

In this paper, I give some arguments to show that the traditional reinforcement learning paradigm fails to model this type of learning system. Some insights into lifelong reinforcement learning are provided, along with a simplistic prototype lifelong reinforcement learning system.

Title: Recruitment-imitation Mechanism for Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning
Abstract:
  Reinforcement learning, evolutionary algorithms and imitation learning are three principal methods to deal with continuous control tasks. Reinforcement learning is sample efficient, yet sensitive to hyper-parameters setting and needs efficient exploration; Evolutionary algorithms are stable, but with low sample efficiency; Imitation learning is both sample efficient and stable, however it requires the guidance of expert data. In this paper, we propose Recruitment-imitation Mechanism (RIM) for evolutionary reinforcement learning, a scalable framework that combines advantages of the three methods mentioned above. The core of this framework is a dual-actors and single critic reinforcement learning agent. This agent can recruit high-fitness actors from the population of evolutionary algorithms, which instructs itself to learn from experience replay buffer. At the same time, low-fitness actors in the evolutionary population can imitate behavior patterns of the reinforcement learning agent and improve their adaptability. Reinforcement and imitation learners in this framework can be replaced with any off-policy actor-critic reinforcement learner or data-driven imitation learner. We evaluate RIM on a series of benchmarks for continuous control tasks in Mujoco. The experimental results show that RIM outperforms prior evolutionary or reinforcement learning methods. The performance of RIM's components is significantly better than components of previous evolutionary reinforcement learning algorithm, and the recruitment using soft update enables reinforcement learning agent to learn faster than that using hard update.

Title: A View on Deep Reinforcement Learning in System Optimization
Abstract:
  Many real-world systems problems require reasoning about the long term consequences of actions taken to configure and manage the system. These problems with delayed and often sequentially aggregated reward, are often inherently reinforcement learning problems and present the opportunity to leverage the recent substantial advances in deep reinforcement learning. However, in some cases, it is not clear why deep reinforcement learning is a good fit for the problem. Sometimes, it does not perform better than the state-of-the-art solutions. And in other cases, random search or greedy algorithms could outperform deep reinforcement learning. In this paper, we review, discuss, and evaluate the recent trends of using deep reinforcement learning in system optimization. We propose a set of essential metrics to guide future works in evaluating the efficacy of using deep reinforcement learning in system optimization. Our evaluation includes challenges, the types of problems, their formulation in the deep reinforcement learning setting, embedding, the model used, efficiency, and robustness. We conclude with a discussion on open challenges and potential directions for pushing further the integration of reinforcement learning in system optimization.
