The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.

Title: Parallel Attention Mechanisms in Neural Machine Translation
Abstract:
  Recent papers in neural machine translation have proposed the strict use of attention mechanisms over previous standards such as recurrent and convolutional neural networks (RNNs and CNNs). We propose that by running traditionally stacked encoding branches from encoder-decoder attention- focused architectures in parallel, that even more sequential operations can be removed from the model and thereby decrease training time. In particular, we modify the recently published attention-based architecture called Transformer by Google, by replacing sequential attention modules with parallel ones, reducing the amount of training time and substantially improving BLEU scores at the same time. Experiments over the English to German and English to French translation tasks show that our model establishes a new state of the art.

Title: Modeling Recurrence for Transformer
Abstract:
  Recently, the Transformer model that is based solely on attention mechanisms, has advanced the state-of-the-art on various machine translation tasks. However, recent studies reveal that the lack of recurrence hinders its further improvement of translation capacity. In response to this problem, we propose to directly model recurrence for Transformer with an additional recurrence encoder. In addition to the standard recurrent neural network, we introduce a novel attentive recurrent network to leverage the strengths of both attention and recurrent networks. Experimental results on the widely-used WMT14 English-German and WMT17 Chinese-English translation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our studies also reveal that the proposed model benefits from a short-cut that bridges the source and target sequences with a single recurrent layer, which outperforms its deep counterpart.

Title: Sequence-to-Sequence Models Can Directly Translate Foreign Speech
Abstract:
  We present a recurrent encoder-decoder deep neural network architecture that directly translates speech in one language into text in another. The model does not explicitly transcribe the speech into text in the source language, nor does it require supervision from the ground truth source language transcription during training. We apply a slightly modified sequence-to-sequence with attention architecture that has previously been used for speech recognition and show that it can be repurposed for this more complex task, illustrating the power of attention-based models. A single model trained end-to-end obtains state-of-the-art performance on the Fisher Callhome Spanish-English speech translation task, outperforming a cascade of independently trained sequence-to-sequence speech recognition and machine translation models by 1.8 BLEU points on the Fisher test set. In addition, we find that making use of the training data in both languages by multi-task training sequence-to-sequence speech translation and recognition models with a shared encoder network can improve performance by a further 1.4 BLEU points.

Title: Joint Source-Target Self Attention with Locality Constraints
Abstract:
  The dominant neural machine translation models are based on the encoder-decoder structure, and many of them rely on an unconstrained receptive field over source and target sequences. In this paper we study a new architecture that breaks with both conventions. Our simplified architecture consists in the decoder part of a transformer model, based on self-attention, but with locality constraints applied on the attention receptive field. As input for training, both source and target sentences are fed to the network, which is trained as a language model. At inference time, the target tokens are predicted autoregressively starting with the source sequence as previous tokens. The proposed model achieves a new state of the art of 35.7 BLEU on IWSLT'14 German-English and matches the best reported results in the literature on the WMT'14 English-German and WMT'14 English-French translation benchmarks.

Title: The Best of Both Worlds: Combining Recent Advances in Neural Machine
  Translation
Abstract:
  The past year has witnessed rapid advances in sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) modeling for Machine Translation (MT). The classic RNN-based approaches to MT were first out-performed by the convolutional seq2seq model, which was then out-performed by the more recent Transformer model. Each of these new approaches consists of a fundamental architecture accompanied by a set of modeling and training techniques that are in principle applicable to other seq2seq architectures. In this paper, we tease apart the new architectures and their accompanying techniques in two ways. First, we identify several key modeling and training techniques, and apply them to the RNN architecture, yielding a new RNMT+ model that outperforms all of the three fundamental architectures on the benchmark WMT'14 English to French and English to German tasks. Second, we analyze the properties of each fundamental seq2seq architecture and devise new hybrid architectures intended to combine their strengths. Our hybrid models obtain further improvements, outperforming the RNMT+ model on both benchmark datasets.

Title: Widening the Representation Bottleneck in Neural Machine Translation
  with Lexical Shortcuts
Abstract:
  The transformer is a state-of-the-art neural translation model that uses attention to iteratively refine lexical representations with information drawn from the surrounding context. Lexical features are fed into the first layer and propagated through a deep network of hidden layers. We argue that the need to represent and propagate lexical features in each layer limits the model's capacity for learning and representing other information relevant to the task. To alleviate this bottleneck, we introduce gated shortcut connections between the embedding layer and each subsequent layer within the encoder and decoder. This enables the model to access relevant lexical content dynamically, without expending limited resources on storing it within intermediate states. We show that the proposed modification yields consistent improvements over a baseline transformer on standard WMT translation tasks in 5 translation directions (0.9 BLEU on average) and reduces the amount of lexical information passed along the hidden layers. We furthermore evaluate different ways to integrate lexical connections into the transformer architecture and present ablation experiments exploring the effect of proposed shortcuts on model behavior.

Title: Weighted Transformer Network for Machine Translation
Abstract:
  State-of-the-art results on neural machine translation often use attentional sequence-to-sequence models with some form of convolution or recursion. Vaswani et al. (2017) propose a new architecture that avoids recurrence and convolution completely. Instead, it uses only self-attention and feed-forward layers. While the proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on several machine translation tasks, it requires a large number of parameters and training iterations to converge. We propose Weighted Transformer, a Transformer with modified attention layers, that not only outperforms the baseline network in BLEU score but also converges 15-40% faster. Specifically, we replace the multi-head attention by multiple self-attention branches that the model learns to combine during the training process. Our model improves the state-of-the-art performance by 0.5 BLEU points on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task and by 0.4 on the English-to-French translation task.

Title: Transformer++
Abstract:
  Recent advancements in attention mechanisms have replaced recurrent neural networks and its variants for machine translation tasks. Transformer using attention mechanism solely achieved state-of-the-art results in sequence modeling. Neural machine translation based on the attention mechanism is parallelizable and addresses the problem of handling long-range dependencies among words in sentences more effectively than recurrent neural networks. One of the key concepts in attention is to learn three matrices, query, key, and value, where global dependencies among words are learned through linearly projecting word embeddings through these matrices. Multiple query, key, value matrices can be learned simultaneously focusing on a different subspace of the embedded dimension, which is called multi-head in Transformer. We argue that certain dependencies among words could be learned better through an intermediate context than directly modeling word-word dependencies. This could happen due to the nature of certain dependencies or lack of patterns that lend them difficult to be modeled globally using multi-head self-attention. In this work, we propose a new way of learning dependencies through a context in multi-head using convolution. This new form of multi-head attention along with the traditional form achieves better results than Transformer on the WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks. We also introduce a framework to learn POS tagging and NER information during the training of encoder which further improves results achieving a new state-of-the-art of 32.1 BLEU, better than existing best by 1.4 BLEU, on the WMT 2014 English-to-German and 44.6 BLEU, better than existing best by 1.1 BLEU, on the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks. We call this Transformer++.

Title: Pervasive Attention: 2D Convolutional Neural Networks for
  Sequence-to-Sequence Prediction
Abstract:
  Current state-of-the-art machine translation systems are based on encoder-decoder architectures, that first encode the input sequence, and then generate an output sequence based on the input encoding. Both are interfaced with an attention mechanism that recombines a fixed encoding of the source tokens based on the decoder state. We propose an alternative approach which instead relies on a single 2D convolutional neural network across both sequences. Each layer of our network re-codes source tokens on the basis of the output sequence produced so far. Attention-like properties are therefore pervasive throughout the network. Our model yields excellent results, outperforming state-of-the-art encoder-decoder systems, while being conceptually simpler and having fewer parameters.
