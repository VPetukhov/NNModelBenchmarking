Title: Approaches to Artificial General Intelligence: An Analysis
Abstract:
  This paper is an analysis of the different methods proposed to achieve AGI, including Human Brain Emulation, AIXI and Integrated Cognitive Architecture. First, the definition of AGI as used in this paper has been defined, and its requirements have been stated. For each proposed method mentioned, the method in question was summarized and its key processes were detailed, showcasing how it functioned. Then, each method listed was analyzed, taking various factors into consideration, such as technological requirements, computational ability, and adequacy to the requirements. It was concluded that while there are various methods to achieve AGI that could work, such as Human Brain Emulation and Integrated Cognitive Architectures, the most promising method to achieve AGI is Integrated Cognitive Architectures. This is because Human Brain Emulation was found to require scanning technologies that will most likely not be available until the 2030s, making it unlikely to be created before then. Moreover, Integrated Cognitive Architectures has reduced computational requirements and a suitable functionality for General Intelligence, making it the most likely way to achieve AGI.

Title: Measuring Intelligence through Games
Abstract:
  Artificial general intelligence (AGI) refers to research aimed at tackling the full problem of artificial intelligence, that is, create truly intelligent agents. This sets it apart from most AI research which aims at solving relatively narrow domains, such as character recognition, motion planning, or increasing player satisfaction in games. But how do we know when an agent is truly intelligent? A common point of reference in the AGI community is Legg and Hutter's formal definition of universal intelligence, which has the appeal of simplicity and generality but is unfortunately incomputable. Games of various kinds are commonly used as benchmarks for "narrow" AI research, as they are considered to have many important properties. We argue that many of these properties carry over to the testing of general intelligence as well. We then sketch how such testing could practically be carried out. The central part of this sketch is an extension of universal intelligence to deal with finite time, and the use of sampling of the space of games expressed in a suitably biased game description language.

Title: Mesarovician Abstract Learning Systems
Abstract:
  The solution methods used to realize artificial general intelligence (AGI) may not contain the formalism needed to adequately model and characterize AGI. In particular, current approaches to learning hold notions of problem domain and problem task as fundamental precepts, but it is hardly apparent that an AGI encountered in the wild will be discernable into a set of domain-task pairings. Nor is it apparent that the outcomes of AGI in a system can be well expressed in terms of domain and task, or as consequences thereof. Thus, there is both a practical and theoretical use for meta-theories of learning which do not express themselves explicitly in terms of solution methods. General systems theory offers such a meta-theory. Herein, Mesarovician abstract systems theory is used as a super-structure for learning. Abstract learning systems are formulated. Subsequent elaboration stratifies the assumptions of learning systems into a hierarchy and considers the hierarchy such stratification projects onto learning theory. The presented Mesarovician abstract learning systems theory calls back to the founding motivations of artificial intelligence research by focusing on the thinking participants directly, in this case, learning systems, in contrast to the contemporary focus on the problems thinking participants solve.

Title: Analysis of Algorithms and Partial Algorithms
Abstract:
  We present an alternative methodology for the analysis of algorithms, based on the concept of expected discounted reward. This methodology naturally handles algorithms that do not always terminate, so it can (theoretically) be used with partial algorithms for undecidable problems, such as those found in artificial general intelligence (AGI) and automated theorem proving. We mention an approach to self-improving AGI enabled by this methodology.   Aug 2017 addendum: This article was originally written with multiple audiences in mind. It is really best put in the following terms. Goertzel, Hutter, Legg, and others have developed a definition of an intelligence score for a general abstract agent: expected lifetime reward in a random environment. AIXI is generally the optimal agent according to this score, but there may be reasons to analyze other agents and compare score values. If we want to use this definition of intelligence in practice, perhaps we can start by analyzing some simple agents. Common algorithms can be thought of as simple agents (environment is input, reward is based on running time) so we take the goal of applying the agent intelligence score to algorithms. That is, we want to find, what are the IQ scores of algorithms? We can do some very simple analysis, but the real answer is that even for simple algorithms, the intelligence score is too difficult to work with in practice.

Title: An AGI with Time-Inconsistent Preferences
Abstract:
  This paper reveals a trap for artificial general intelligence (AGI) theorists who use economists' standard method of discounting. This trap is implicitly and falsely assuming that a rational AGI would have time-consistent preferences. An agent with time-inconsistent preferences knows that its future self will disagree with its current self concerning intertemporal decision making. Such an agent cannot automatically trust its future self to carry out plans that its current self considers optimal.

Title: The Embeddings World and Artificial General Intelligence
Abstract:
  From early days, a key and controversial question inside the artificial intelligence community was whether Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is achievable. AGI is the ability of machines and computer programs to achieve human-level intelligence and do all tasks that a human being can. While there exist a number of systems in the literature claiming they realize AGI, several other researchers argue that it is impossible to achieve it. In this paper, we take a different view to the problem. First, we discuss that in order to realize AGI, along with building intelligent machines and programs, an intelligent world should also be constructed which is on the one hand, an accurate approximation of our world and on the other hand, a significant part of reasoning of intelligent machines is already embedded in this world. Then we discuss that AGI is not a product or algorithm, rather it is a continuous process which will become more and more mature over time (like human civilization and wisdom). Then, we argue that pre-trained embeddings play a key role in building this intelligent world and as a result, realizing AGI. We discuss how pre-trained embeddings facilitate achieving several characteristics of human-level intelligence, such as embodiment, common sense knowledge, unconscious knowledge and continuality of learning, by machines.

Title: AGI Safety Literature Review
Abstract:
  The development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) promises to be a major event. Along with its many potential benefits, it also raises serious safety concerns (Bostrom, 2014). The intention of this paper is to provide an easily accessible and up-to-date collection of references for the emerging field of AGI safety. A significant number of safety problems for AGI have been identified. We list these, and survey recent research on solving them. We also cover works on how best to think of AGI from the limited knowledge we have today, predictions for when AGI will first be created, and what will happen after its creation. Finally, we review the current public policy on AGI.

Title: Asymptotically Unambitious Artificial General Intelligence
Abstract:
  General intelligence, the ability to solve arbitrary solvable problems, is supposed by many to be artificially constructible. Narrow intelligence, the ability to solve a given particularly difficult problem, has seen impressive recent development. Notable examples include self-driving cars, Go engines, image classifiers, and translators. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) presents dangers that narrow intelligence does not: if something smarter than us across every domain were indifferent to our concerns, it would be an existential threat to humanity, just as we threaten many species despite no ill will. Even the theory of how to maintain the alignment of an AGI's goals with our own has proven highly elusive. We present the first algorithm we are aware of for asymptotically unambitious AGI, where "unambitiousness" includes not seeking arbitrary power. Thus, we identify an exception to the Instrumental Convergence Thesis, which is roughly that by default, an AGI would seek power, including over us.

Title: Modus ponens and modus tollens for the compositional rule of inference
  with aggregation functions
Abstract:
  The compositional rule of inference (CRI) proposed by Zadeh has been widely applied in artificial intelligence, control, data mining, image processing, decision making and so on. Recently, Li and Zeng [Li, D., Zeng, Q. Approximate reasoning with aggregation functions satisfying GMP rules, Artificial Intelligence Review (2022), https://doi.org/10.1007/s10462-022-10136-1] shown an A-compositional rule of inference (ACRI) method in which generalizes the t-norm to any aggregation function in CRI method and studied its validity using GMP rules. In this paper, we continue to investigate the validity of ACRI method from a logical view and an interpolative view. Specifically, to discuss the modus ponens (MP) and modus tollens (MT) properties of ACRI method based on well-known fuzzy implications with aggregation functions.

Title: Artificial Open World for Evaluating AGI: a Conceptual Design
Abstract:
  How to evaluate Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a critical problem that is discussed and unsolved for a long period. In the research of narrow AI, this seems not a severe problem, since researchers in that field focus on some specific problems as well as one or some aspects of cognition, and the criteria for evaluation are explicitly defined. By contrast, an AGI agent should solve problems that are never-encountered by both agents and developers. However, once a developer tests and debugs the agent with a problem, the never-encountered problem becomes the encountered problem, as a result, the problem is solved by the developers to some extent, exploiting their experience, rather than the agents. This conflict, as we call the trap of developers' experience, leads to that this kind of problems is probably hard to become an acknowledged criterion. In this paper, we propose an evaluation method named Artificial Open World, aiming to jump out of the trap. The intuition is that most of the experience in the actual world should not be necessary to be applied to the artificial world, and the world should be open in some sense, such that developers are unable to perceive the world and solve problems by themselves before testing, though after that they are allowed to check all the data. The world is generated in a similar way as the actual world, and a general form of problems is proposed. A metric is proposed aiming to quantify the progress of research. This paper describes the conceptual design of the Artificial Open World, though the formalization and the implementation are left to the future.
